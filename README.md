# Kottans Backend

Though I was familiar with most of the material it was still very interesting to review it. I especially enjoyed the udacity git course.

## Unix shell

Making interactive tutorials was fun, but I knew already most of it's contents. Linuxcommand was actually much more fun. Especially I liked how a guy called Windows "legacy operating system" and "the other operating system" as if it was Lord Voldemort and you can't say its name.\
And I was also familiar with, but again amused by a weird way the bash shell defines function: with brackets just as a useless sintax marker and passing arguments as command line arguments. I am shure, there's a very good reason to make it like this, but it turnes reading function arguments into a tricky business.

## Git Collaboration

I was quite unfamilliar with forking and making pull requests, because I used git mostly for my own individual work. Also git rebase looks like a very powerfull tool which needs more looking into.

## NodeJS Basics 1

I was completely new to Node.js streaming and libraries, because used javascript before for frontend programming only. But the thing I was mostly impressed was the 'trampoline' template for a recursion. Recursion is a very powerfull conception, which really permits to solve some problems in a simple and elegant way, but it requires a lot of hardware resources for a stack of calls. The 'trampoline' thing removes that problem completely and I am absolutely intending to use it in future.

## Memory Management

If program reaches the maximul limit of stack there will be a stack overflow and the programm will receive a Segmentation Fault exception.

If programm requests a big memory allocation on heap, the block of memory will be created not on heap, but in the memory mapping segment.

Data memory segment stores the content of static variables, initialized in the source code. It is writable. Unlike data segment, text segment is not writable, but executable. It contains programm code and string literals.

Heap - 0226c000-023ef000, Stack - 7fffd910f000-7fffd990f000, MMS - 7f4cee590000-7f4cee59b000

New for me was the existance of memory mapping segment, different from the heap. I was surpised by the existance of memory leaks and need to prevent them in javascript â€” it appears than you should mind you memory allocation even if you write in a language with garbage collector.

## TCP. UDP. Network

![intertet101](task_networks/internent_101.png)

![networking](task_networks/networking.png)

I learned something new and was very surprised not by the lessons, but by something I've got to know while completing the coding tasks. It appears that there is absolutely, completely, literally no way in javascript to wait for a promice result in a sync code. So, I've spent some exciting time, making out how make proper promices from async funtions not returning promices and make them execute consequently. And I am positively shall use this in future;

## HTTP & HTTPS

My curl request to github api were:

`curl https://api.github.com/users/eoneoff`

`curl -i https://api.github.com/users/eoneoff`

`curl --user "eoneoff:******" https://api.github.com/gists/starred`

`curl -i https://api.github.com/orgs/kottans/repos`

```bash
curl -H 'Authorization: token *******'
        -d '{
            "title": "Test issue for kottans",
            "body": "I have got no body",
            "labels":["no_actual_problem"]}'
    https://api.github.com/repos/eoneoff/kottans-backend/issues
```

1. Three possible negative consequences of not using https are comprimising pirvacy and intergity of your data, sent on network and wrong identification of the one, you are comminicating with. Comprimising privacy means, that without https your data can easily be intercepted and read. Comprimising integrity means, than your intercepted data can be not only read, but also changed without you or the receiver knowing. And comporomising identification means than you can be fooled in beleaving into communicating with someone, while you would be communicating with imposter.

2. The public key cyrptografy is a method of data decription, in which there exists two keys: pulic, known for everyone, and private, known only to the owner. Data, encripted by public key can be decripted by private key, but not by public key. And vice-versa, data, decripted by private key, can be decripted by public key. So, having someone public key we can decript data, send in to the person and he and only he can decript the data. On the other hand, if we receive an encripted message and dercipti in with the person's public key, we know, that we had really received it from that person, because only he could have encripted it.

3. Pet clininc requests:

   1. Add new pet: POST request with json object wit pet data in request body.
   2. Search pet by name: a GET request with pet name in query path or query params:

        `clinic/pets/search/<pet_name>`

        or

        `clinic/pets/search?name=<pet_name>`

   3. Change name of exitsting pet: a PUT request with pet id or name in the path and new pet data in the json object in the body
   4. Add new info about pet health: POST or PUT request, depending on the database structure and design decisions (PUT new info is stored as a addition or change to existing record in database or POST if it is stored as a new record, the latter is better option) with the info in the request body
   5. Assing pet to a particular doctor in the clinic: again, POST or PUT request
   6. Register an appointment for a pet: POST request with new appointment data in the request body

## Patterns

![architecture&design](task_patterns/architecture&design.png)

There was a lot of new to me in the Udacity Acthitecture and Design course and though it is rather long and academic, there are some things about development and design of code which I intend to use. Also I was somewhat surprised by the way python developers understand design patterns â€” just as a way to implement some features your language doesn't have "out of the box". If find this idea quite wrong.

## Data Structures

Comparing to previous lesson (Patterns) if was very short and easy, even shorter and easier, than I'd like. But there was a coding task and that was good. Going on.
